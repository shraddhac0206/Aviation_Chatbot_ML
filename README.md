## Overview

The aviation sector is facing increasing operational costs and climate pressures. To address these, the **Aviation ML Chatbot** provides:

- A conversational AI assistant for aviation queries
- Forecasting models to anticipate fuel needs and flight patterns
- Interactive visualizations of emission and fuel data
- Cloud-native design for high scalability and integration

---

## Key Features

-  **AI Chatbot**: Answers aviation questions related to fuel, emissions, and routes using the OpenAI API and LangChain
-  **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasts fuel consumption, delays, and traffic using ARIMA, LSTM, and Random Forest
-  **Document Parsing**: Extracts data from PDFs, CSVs, and TXT using AWS Textract
-  **Visual Analytics**: Generates heatmaps, time-series charts, and route comparisons
-  **Cloud Architecture**: Hosted on AWS (Lambda, EC2, S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB)
